# Model Configuration

DojoAgents reads LLM provider configuration from:

```text
~/.dojo/agents.yaml
```

## Interactive Setup

```bash
dojoagents model
```

Custom config file:

```bash
dojoagents model --config ./agents.yaml
```

The command lets you choose a provider, set a base URL, enter an API key, probe available models, and save the result.

Probed models are saved as the provider's `models` candidates, while the
selected model remains its `model` default. The Dashboard exposes the current
configured choices through `GET /api/v1/models`.

## Rules

- Runtime code should read typed config through `ConfigStore.snapshot()`.
- Dashboard/API exposure must use redacted config.
- YAML may reference environment variables such as `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`.
- A provider can add request headers with an `extra_headers` string mapping;
  environment placeholders are supported in header values.

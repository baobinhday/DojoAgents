# DojoAgents: Full-Market AI Copilot for Personal Investment

DojoAgents is a full-market AI agent framework designed specifically for personal investment. Built to bridge the gap between individual investors and institutional-grade tools, its true powerhouse is a state-of-the-art Agent Loop engine. Instead of a simple dashboard, DojoAgents deploys an autonomous reasoning agent that lives alongside your portfolio, handling everything from full-market data cognition to dynamic cross-market strategy deduction.

## ✨ Why DojoAgents?

**🧠 Loop-Driven Cognitive Portfolio Agent (Our Core Engine):** Most financial AI tools are built for quick outputs: news summaries, single-stock explanations, basic indicator readings, or generic market commentary. Our Loop-Driven Cognitive Portfolio Agent is built for portfolio-aware reasoning, connecting your holdings with market data and running structured analysis across four dimensions:
* **Fundamental Data Cognition:** Instantly fetches, structures, and cross-references raw multi-market data (K-lines, financials, news).
* **Advanced Logic Analysis:** Interprets valuation bands, momentum indicators, and sector taxonomy to uncover hidden market mechanics.
* **Cross-Market Strategy Deduction:** Formulates macro asset allocation and maps market linkages (e.g., autonomously reasoning through *"Why US semiconductor software dropped while A-shares surged"* via multi-step tool execution).
* **Dynamic Portfolio Management:** Continuously diagnoses risk exposure, monitors net-worth curves, and evaluates performance attribution to support more informed rebalancing decisions.

**📊 Four-Pillar Dashboard:** An out-of-the-box, institutional-grade React SPA featuring:
- **Portfolio (The Command Center):** Net worth curves, live risk exposure, and smart position tracking.
- **Markets:** Cross-market heatmaps (US/HK/A-shares) and index tracking.
- **Sectors:** Deep-dive L1/L2/L3 taxonomy and momentum curves.
- **Equities:** K-lines, PE bands, financials, and news—all in one unified view.

**🤖 Autonomous Quant Analyst:** Powered by multi-agent collaboration, it autonomously conducts background market research, tracks sector rotations, and monitors your risk exposure while you sleep.

**📱 Planned Omnichannel Updates:** Future versions will support personalized daily briefings and alert notifications through Slack, Telegram, Discord, Feishu, WeChat, or email.

## 📈 What DojoAgents Can Do

### 1. Daily Market Overview

*"What's worth watching in global markets today?"* — one of the most common questions investors ask every morning. Behind it lies cross-market moves, sector rotation, stock anomalies, sentiment, and potential catalysts.

DojoAgents enters a data-gathering phase, calling global market, sector, and equity tools to pull movers, strength rankings, price changes, volume shifts, and sector distribution across A-shares, US equities, and HK stocks. Throughout the run, expand any intermediate step to see which tools were invoked, what data was cited, and how the analysis progressed.

</div>

### 2. News Impact Analysis

When breaking news hits, the first question is always: *which stocks will be affected?*

Take Meta's recent AI infrastructure moves — A-share investors naturally asked: *"Meta selling compute capacity — which US and A-share stocks could be impacted?"* DojoAgents decomposes the question, then gathers data via market, news, company, and sector tools: Meta's price action, related headlines, market performance, and segments like US tech, AI compute chains, semiconductors, cloud, and ad-tech.

</div>

### 3. Portfolio Diagnosis from a Screenshot

DojoAgents supports multimodal models — upload a holdings screenshot and get a full portfolio diagnosis. No manual data entry required.

Upload a screenshot with 40+ positions spanning A-shares, US stocks, and ETFs. DojoAgents recognizes each holding, re-groups them by market, sector, and supply-chain position, then generates a risk diagnosis — flagging over-concentration, overlapping exposure, and insufficient defensive assets. Despite 40+ names, many positions effectively bet on the same theme; a broad pullback in semiconductors, AI compute, or growth stocks could drag the entire portfolio down together.

    width="720"
  />
</div>

### 4. Simulated Portfolio from Recommendations

After the diagnosis, DojoAgents proposes follow-up strategies — trim duplicate positions, keep core names, optimize US allocation, reduce weak exposures, and add defensive assets like utilities and consumer staples. Once you approve the recommendations, it can generate a new watchlist portfolio and track it continuously in the Dashboard.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Deploying your DojoAgents environment is designed to be frictionless. We strongly recommend using uv for lightning-fast dependency management.

### 1. Requirements

- **Python** >= 3.11
- **Node.js**: >= 18 (for frontend build)
- **npm**: >= 9
- An LLM **API Key** (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, etc.)

### 2. Core Installation

#### Quick Install (PyPI)

For most users, install the published package directly—no clone or frontend build required:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install dojoagents

# Windows (PowerShell)
uv venv && .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uv pip install dojoagents

# Windows (CMD)
uv venv && .venv\Scripts\activate.bat 
uv pip install dojoagents
```

Then skip to [Launching the Server](#4-launching-the-server).

#### Install from Source (Developers)

Runtime dependencies are listed in both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install in "editable mode" with dev tools. Any source code changes will take
# effect immediately—perfect for building custom tools or debugging the Agent Loop.
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 3. Dashboard Build

The DojoAgents Dashboard is a high-performance React SPA powered by Vite, communicating with a FastAPI backend via an OpenAI-compatible chat API and SSE streaming for dynamic Canvas chart rendering.

If you are building from source, you will need Node.js (>= 18) and npm (>= 9).
```bash
cd dojoagents/dashboard/web
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Launching the Server

```bash
dojoagents dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8765/ in your browser to access your personal financial command center.

### 5. Configure Your LLM Engine (In-App)

Once the dashboard is live, click on the Settings icon. DojoAgents features a comprehensive graphical interface to securely configure your preferred Large Language Models.

- **Supported Providers**: Out-of-the-box presets for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Zhipu GLM, and DeepSeek.
- **Local & Custom Endpoints**: Easily override Base URLs to connect to local instances like Ollama, llama.cpp, or vLLM.
- **Secure Storage**: All API keys and endpoint settings entered in the UI are securely written to your local ~/.dojo/agents.yaml file.


## 🧠 Core Architecture

As illustrated in the diagram above, DojoAgents is engineered for scale, deep contextual reasoning, and absolute privacy.

- **Agent Loop Engine:** The core reasoning runtime. Handles multi-turn tool orchestration, context window compression, and strict guardrails to prevent financial hallucinations.
- **Execution Sandbox:** A secure, isolated environment for on-the-fly Python code execution, technical indicator calculations, and local web data extraction.
- **Memory & SKILLS:** Automatically distills successful, multi-step market analysis workflows into reusable, programmatic SKILLS for future execution.
- **Cron & Gateway:** Decoupled delivery pipelines that push scheduled, automated insights directly to your preferred chat applications, without blocking the main Agent reasoning loop.

### Harness Runtime

An agent instance is bound to exactly one Harness instance. Core owns the LLM loop, tool execution, lifecycle and principal-scoped Session platform; the Harness owns one scenario's identity, prompts, skills, tools, memory, policies, tasks, presenters, services and surface adapters. The built-in financial scenario is selected by default:

```yaml
harness:
  id: financial
  factory: dojoagents.harnesses.built_in.financial:create_harness
  config:
    backend: sdk
```

Other projects can provide a Python Harness factory or set `factory: null` and `manifest: ./my-harness.yaml` for the constrained `dojoagents/v1alpha1` declarative format. Extra skill/tool directories supplement the bound Harness and cannot silently replace its owned components.

The Financial Harness owns agent behavior—prompts, ToolSpecs, policies, memory,
tasks, and result presentation. The FastAPI Dashboard independently owns the
financial application backend—routers, API schemas, stores, refresh/precompute
jobs, portfolio data, and service lifecycle. Embedded Dashboard deployments bind
their existing financial backend into Runtime; CLI or Gateway deployments can use
the standalone SDK backend or a configured remote HTTP backend.

Sessions are scoped by `(tenant_id, user_id, session_id)` and can use file or project-provided stores. See the [external SessionStore / BlobStore adapter contract](docs/session-store-adapter.md) for online MySQL/PostgreSQL/object-storage deployments.
